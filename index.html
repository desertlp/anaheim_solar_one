                Anaheim Solar One, LLC intends to develop a 3-megawatt solar photovoltaic Project in Anaheim Hills, California. The Site is zoned Open Space as the Site is vacant land with rolling hills and featureless topography suitable for solar development. Anaheim Solar One, LLC has requested a Conditional Use Permit for the Site. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Potential environmental impacts associated with solar development at the Site and feasible measures to minimize these impacts have been identified prior to submission for City approval. Our environmental firm has provided an objective and informed evaluation of potential impacts regarding the land use and environmental subject areas covered under the California Environmental Quality Act. The following technical studies have been conducted: Biological resources assessment, cultural and tribal resource investigation, noise study, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions study, traffic study. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Project Site is located at the intersection of Cannon Street and Via Escola Drive and is in the community of Anaheim Hills within the City of Anaheim and the County of Orange. The Site was historically used as a recreation space for riding and hiking, and has been formally zoned as Open Space. Adjoining land uses include residential communities to the North and South East, and land also zoned at Open Space to the West, South, and North East. Once construction is completed, Anaheim Solar One, LLC intends to plant hundreds of fast-growing trees. These trees will provide both an aesthetic and practical purpose by creating a park-like setting and eventually blocking most of the Project from neighborhoods downhill from the Site. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Site is very hilly and does not provide adequate footing for homes or commercial buildings, but with advanced solar technology, the topography is suitable for solar development with minimal clearing and grading. Project operations will typically be unattended, and quiet, with routine maintenance and washing, typically twice a year. The Project will be compatible with surrounding uses, residential and undeveloped land, without causing a detriment to the particular area or to health and safety as the Project has been designed to mitigate issues with flora and fauna of the area while silently providing clean power to the region.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The entrance to the Site is located at the intersection of Cannon Street and Via Escola Drive in the community of Anaheim Hills within the City of Anaheim and the County of Orange. Cannon Street is a not a heavily trafficked road, and will not impose an undue burden upon the roads designed and constructed to handle the traffic in the area, as this section of the road does not service commercial areas. Rather, it services a small number of residential communities and the Southern California Edison Substation in close proximity to the Project. 
                Approval of this Conditional Use Permit will not harm the health and safety of the citizens of the City of Anaheim. Once constructed, the Project will passively generate electric output during daylight hours without air or noise emissions. The Project will provide the community a park-like setting with hundreds of trees, trails, and benches gated off from the electrical components of the Project that shall be a benefit to the health and safety of the community.
